## Who I am

A computer science student evolved in a lot of fun things! Besides studying in Uppsala, Sweden I run a IT-Firm together with two friends whom I met during my first year as a student in Uppsala.

  Hey there! Are you an employer looking for a new developer to help the company reach new heights? Why not send me a message, cause you guessed it! I'm looking for employment after my studies!

## The holy spare time

Is spent best developing new projects or working with pushing Kodstugan to new heights. Kodstugan is a newly started initiative created for the sole reason to give students a way to get together and meet other students with interest in the field of software development.

The reason for starting Kodstugan was the lack of help from Uppsala university in giving help when it comes to coding. Even though we read at least one course around software development per period there have been very small effort from the university side to give students a place to get help with school work related to courses with coding assignments.
Since starting kodstugan we've gone from only gathering and doing coursework to host events together with local companies related to the IT-sector.

Couple of related events we've hosted are CodeJams, Lectures & Workshops.

## Learnings

From two years of studying computer science during that time having my own company on the side, I've learned how important it is to take responsibility and more so the importance of communication.

There is literally to much to write down, I'd recommend reading my [Curriculum vitae](http://skurken.se/CV)
