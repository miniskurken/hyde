I just want to point out how well made the tour of Golang is. Coming from the programming language C it's incredible how easy it is to follow. Having read some courses in Javascript & Computer Architecture is a great help since Go allows you to do very low level coding.

Would really recommend you to sit down and go through the [tutorial](https://tour.golang.org) if you ever decide to give Golang a try.
