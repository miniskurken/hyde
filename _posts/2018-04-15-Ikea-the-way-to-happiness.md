title: Master of procrastination

Today I woke up way to late for my own good, and to make it all even worse. Instead of putting the effort into learning Golang, something required of me in the course of Operating Systems and Process-Oriented Programming, I decided to take the next best bus into Ikea and buy furniture for the room i'm soon to leave.

And the reason for it? Just did not have enough of pillows to feel comfortable while coding laying in bed.

> A facepalm is the physical gesture of placing one's hand across one's face or lowering one's face into one's hand or hands, covering or closing one's eyes. The gesture is often exaggerated by giving the motion more force and making a slapping noise when the hand comes in contact with the face.
