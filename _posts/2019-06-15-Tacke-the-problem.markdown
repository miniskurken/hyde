**Productivity**, *how do we achieve it?*
A good question I've woken up and thought for the last two weeks. But it never comes to a straight answer, never have I come to a conclusion of *"This is how I'm supposed to do it."*

Why is there that when I need something finished, it will rarely get done, but if a friend of mine asks for help, it will always get done?

However, I've just started to tackle the problem of focusing on the project it in itself is to write a thesis about Logging, Metrics & Tracing. To create a good paper, I feel the need to read through multiple long pieces of research and books regarding the subject. So what's my way of trying to keep the focus on the report for now?

Here come the multiple steps I take:

1. Start your day with a routine.
Saying this sounds so clich√©, but it is helping me tremendously with keeping the focus throughout the day. The thing is it could be almost anything that will clear your head for a while, for instance, what I do is sit down, put on music, and draw for an hour or two. But maybe what you need is a healthy breakfast where you solve a crossword while eating? **No one knows except you.**

2. Don't stay where the distractions exists, turn off the sound and vibrations of your phone. Leave the apartment & log out of Facebook / Instagram or any other social media app you follow.

3. Write down all you want to do for the day on POST-IT notes, one small task on each one and work your way through them giving yourself some rewards after finishing one. Could be allowing yourself to check Instagram or sending that Snapchat message!

4. Look at all the news positively, not everything may seem like a good thing, but it has its reasons.
