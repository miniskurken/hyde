A couple of times the thought of maintaining a blog has come to my mind, however the thought alone frightens me. I feel that maintaining a actual blog seems like a easy task, but when the time comes and you actually are doing so, the task itself becomes this impossible quest.

  > What kind of response do I need to get from readers in order to feel enough pleasure to continue writing posts about stuff I've learnt in either school here in Uppsala or in Hanoi once i start studying there in August.

What would you like to see in order to continue reading the silly posts of this student?

Give me tips on topics to write about, put a issue on Github for me to write a post about a specific topic.
